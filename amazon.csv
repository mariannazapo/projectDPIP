The only cat bed ever my 14yo ginger ninja has ever liked,"This is the only bed his Lordship has ever accepted in his life. I keep forgetting how picky he is. Clearly too small for him, but he does not sleep on anything else now. I am still amazed.A lucky find.",5,2024-06-22
Absolutely rubbish!!!,"It‚Äôs tiny, like an ugly little hat. Literally fits on my head. It‚Äôs a weird shape. Complete waste of money",1,2024-06-08
Kitten bed,"Fabulous and soft kitten bed :) little one loves it :) I bought 2 :) the 3 year old kitty has turned her nose up for now but I'm sure she will eventually use it, she's a bit of a snob anyway ü§£ our new kitten however loves it and fits perfect into the smallest one with plenty of room üòä  great quality, very fluffy and soft quick delivery,  thankyou x",5,2023-09-17
So soft and comfy,"I bought this when I first got my kitten, he loved laying in it, it‚Äôs so soft for them.",4,2024-05-11
Very soft,"This was a fairly cheap item and I think that shows in the quality as the product doesn't have the greatest of finishes and its a bit of a messy finish on one part.  That said, it was cheap and it does the job, the base is thinner than expected but it sticks to the floor as described and does the job needed",3,2023-11-10
Really flimsy and not the best quality but it does the job,"It‚Äôs a little noisy, flimsy and just not the best quality. In actually fluff however is soft and I‚Äôm assuming comfy. It is incredibly small tho my kitten is 12 weeks and is already a little too big and prefers another bed. I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable putting into the wash as it feels like it could just fall apart, the filling isn‚Äôt exactly full hence why it‚Äôs so floppy not very nice but will do the job until I purchase a different one",2,2023-11-19
Quite small,"Smaller than I thought but doesn't bother any of our three cats, first come, first in bed!!!",5,2024-05-13
Lovely item but cant get cat in it!,You know what cats are like.They do what they want when they want.The only want love from u on their terms .They cry for ur attention then claw u when u stroke them ' wrong '.So i bought this for our oldest cat as a Xmas present who turned her nose up at it persuading our other 2 cats not to lay in it either!I still live in hope that one day one of them will change their mind but all i can do is admire & stroke the lovely soft bed & wish i could fit in it myself.,5,2024-03-10
It was dispatched quickly,"It was smaller than I thought. But my cat goes to sleep on it at night, she likes it. It's warm and cosy.",4,2024-03-02
"A bit deflated, and rather small.","Could do with more stuffing - reasonable for the cheap price, I suppose.The cat is small, but this bed is smaller. OK for a narrower high up perching spot, on a shelf, for example.",3,2024-03-22
Nothing like on the photo,It‚Äôs not really a bed but more a round shaped fluff thing. There is a non slip base but expected it to be more like a nest as the photos show. I‚Äôve now but it in the box it came in so I e still created a nice little bed for when my kittens come home with me this weekend.,3,2024-02-02
About right for the price but both have a disgusting residue!,"Not the best but they were far cheaper than other ones - you get what you pay for. Barely any stuffing on the base. Size wise, better for kittens (so fine for me) but I wouldnt advise buying them for an adult cat.MAJOR NEGATIVE, when I rubbed my hand over them to see if the 'fur' came off both of them left an awful smelling, oily residue on my hand. Can only assume it's a chemical from the factory process. HIGHLY ADVISE WASHING THEM BEFORE LETTING YOUR PETS NEAR THEM.",3,2023-10-20
Definitely check the size,Very small it would.only do.a kitten not a pup or big cat,3,2024-02-14
"Not much filling, goes flat again.","Followed instructions on fluffing the bed out, did it again this morning but does not seem to have enough filling. Bought this for a miniature dashund for when I need to puppy sit. So has not been used yet. But definitely not enough filling. It is very small, but as its a tiny puppy it will fit, but I think a medium would have been better to  allow for some growth of the dog.",3,2023-09-22
Very small,"Luckily my kitten is still tiny. I didn't read the sizing, it's very small but  soft and comfy",4,2023-12-16
Great but rather small,"My cat loves it but it is very small. As you can see, he only just fits!",3,2024-01-17
Very small,Not worth the money,3,2024-02-04
Looks small but cat likes it,When I opened it I thought it was small and not very padded but gave it ago. My cat took a day before trying it but now sleeps in it. Not ideal for large cats but for cats that like to snuggle or lay in small spaces it's OK.,4,2023-10-21
It's not as big as advertised with full grown cat in it only suitable for kitten,Full grown cat,3,2024-01-19
A bit too small,"I have pretty small adult cats, and by the description this medium size one would be the right size for them, but it is too small for them to sleep in properly. They do like the texture of it though, I think the larger one might be perfect.",3,2023-08-27
Only big enough for a kitten,Only big enough for a kitten,3,2024-01-09
Fluffy and soft,Bo issues its what it says it's soft an lovely to touch x,4,2023-11-22
Too small,"Bed is too small, must be rated as very small. Price reflect the quality as not very good.My be suitable for very small animal, kitten under 6 month old or very small dog.",3,2023-09-20
Very small,I irdered the small bed as my cat is only 2.6kg.This looks like it's designed for a kitten or a guinea pig. I wouldn't have bought it had I realised it was so small!!!,3,2023-09-16
Very small !,"Lovely and soft , but honestly , small kitten or puppy sized , not small cat !",3,2023-11-10
Smaller than expected,"My fault for not looking at the measurements, but cat seems to like snuggling up in it",4,2023-11-04
Nice but too small,Unfortunately to was too small for my wee doggy üêï,3,2023-11-24
cat bed,"fluffy,but not high quality materials used.",3,2023-12-07
Comes up very small,Nice and soft but inner circle extremely small. Too small for cat,3,2023-10-25
Not as plush as I expected,Very thin base. Not as padded as I expected. Cats won‚Äôt use it,3,2023-10-19
Should have read the reviews,Nice quality but very small not suitable for a normal size adult cat.,3,2023-10-09
Ok without cat litter,Lovely little bed but in a crate for kittens with a litter tray very messy and can‚Äôt get it out the fur other than that lovely bed,4,2023-09-07
Looks different,"Is not well represented on the picture and low quality. But it was inexpensive so, you know.",2,2024-04-15
Happy Lola!,Ordered the small one at first but after reading reviews I cancelled and bought bigger. Happy cat! I have 2 more cats who are yet to try it out,5,2024-03-16
Average,"This item came quickly, do not look as advertised though its super thin, nothing like photos advertised and it's very small, not worth the money at all very disapointed",2,2024-03-10
Very small,"My daughter's kitten loves this, it is small great for a small kitten but can't see it being any good for anything bigger. Fluffy and cozy",4,2023-08-05
Very small,"I brought this for a small puppy, the size I received was incredibly small.Not really value for money but would have made a nice bed had it been bigger.",2,2024-02-26
Cat bed,It arrived on time however because of the bed being vacuum packed it in now completely flat.,4,2023-08-08
Very small,"This item is very small, I read the other reviews and was expecting it to be anyway. So, when I received it, I just more or less chucked it down where my quite large cat sleeps, and she decided to sleep on it straightaway with no messing around. Yes, she looks awkward on it and just about fits her body in it, but hey, it works, and she seems quite comfortable, I can hear her snoring on it as I write this",3,2022-09-22
Too small for purpose,My kitten is already too big for it. Should be much bigger,3,2023-07-09
Very small,Even though it‚Äôs small it‚Äôs lovely,5,2024-03-23
Smaller than I expected,Smaller than I expected but it is very soft and well padded.,3,2023-06-23
Perfect size.,"Fits exactly onto the round foot stool that the kittens like to sit on. However, neither of them have sat in it yet. One decided it might be something to eat, and kept nibbling it. Both were more interested in the Amazon paper bag it was packed in. Typical kittens!!",5,2024-01-18
Cat bed,Used for cat but very poor quality.,2,2024-03-08
A lot smaller than expected,It was a lovely material but a lot smaller than I thought,3,2023-05-21
Good value,"We have kittens so perfect size for them. Is extremely soft and cosy. It's comes vacuum packed, so I was worried about it taking shape but just shook it out and it's great. Not a crazy amount of padding on the bottom.",5,2023-12-28
Usefull for SMALL cats!,"Bed is a bit small for my cats. Otjer than that, this is a good value for money purchase.",3,2023-04-13
Super comfy,"My cat was very happy with the bad and was always in it. Sadly he passed away shorty after, he was 17 years old and lived a good life",5,2024-01-31
Fluffy little cat bed.,"This was a little purchase to treat my cat for the winter months. Keep her warm at night. She absolutely loved it, enough room for her to curl up and keep warm. It‚Äôs great value for money with a fluffy ring circle and a harder pimples on the outter bottom so it does slip in wooden floors",5,2023-11-25
VERY small,"For the price‚Ä¶ what did I expect? ü§£ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èSo 2 of my dogs are actually smaller than my cat, so I figured a cat bed would be adequate (normally is, if I‚Äôm shopping from pets at home). You can see in the photo my small chihuahua just about fits, it‚Äôs a squeeze for my toy poodle and my Pomeranian cross‚Ä¶ just forget it ü§£ü§£There‚Äôs no plush on the bottom section, so it‚Äôs probably not all that comfy to lie in, given it‚Äôs a very thin material. It probably also won‚Äôt last two seconds, if one of them tries to chew it ü•¥I can‚Äôt be bothered with the hassle of sending it back, as it was only cheap to begin with, however I certainly wouldn‚Äôt recommend unless you have a small kitten that likes to sleep on a hard surface üôàüôà",2,2022-07-26
Cat bed,"Cats like it, so must be good.",5,2024-02-27
Sleep,"Good and comfort, though my cat likes to stay on bed than this one.",4,2023-05-22
Fluffy comfort,"My cat loves this. So glad I bought it. Poddles on it for ages before settling into a snug curled up ball.  Only trouble is, she is the same colour- blue grey - so I think it‚Äôs her when I see it!",5,2023-12-08
Small,Very small only big enough for a small kitten,3,2023-05-20
Very Flimsy.....,Smaller than expected but that was my error. The quality of this bed is so bad! Really flimsy and the base has almost no filling whatsoever. Be warned.....my pup won't ly in it since he is pretty much lying on hard stone floor with a thin layer of fluff. He's turned it into a toy so have had to bin it because of the choking risk.,1,2024-04-12
You get what you pay for.,This pet bed came vacuum packed and packaged in an envelope. Once opened it started to shape up a little and with a bit of manipulation plumped up a little. It‚Äôs lovely and soft and the perfect size for our new kitten but I think I‚Äôll add some more stuffing to it as it‚Äôs not very padded.,3,2022-08-18
Small is very small.,"The measurements are on there so this is on me really (hence the 5 stars) however I‚Äôm not sure what pet is small enough for this other than new born kitten, a guinea pig or a hamster.",4,2023-01-28
Perfect,"Perfect to snuggle up together as babies, but they are now 11 months and are too big for this bed- shame!",5,2024-02-05
A bit out of shape.,"This is a lovely soft bed and look very cosy however because of how it was packaged, I now can't get it into the shape its supposed to be.",4,2023-03-07
Not as fluffy as it looka,Its tiny ! Middle section looks like it should have a removable padded cushion thing i actually did check on descption to see if it was missing  ! Def not as fluffy and padded as it looks ! If i hadnt been desperate for a bed i would have sent it back .,2,2023-10-09
Not the best,"Its really fluffy but its not as fluffed up and high as the photo,cane in an airtight bag but after trying to fluff it up it still was pretty flat and stuffing still uneven,cats not interested in it",2,2023-12-14
Cheap bed. Low quality,"Bought as cheap, but quality is low. Details say to allow time for filling to plump up, but side padding would not expand to look like photo. No padding on base, so would not make a comfy bed for young kitten.  Returned item and spent more on more luxurious bed",2,2023-10-07
Erm‚Ä¶ not quite there‚Ä¶ but it was very cheap!,"Certainly not as luxurious looking as the product images would have you believe‚Ä¶ you know what they say‚Ä¶ if it looks too good to be true‚Ä¶ ?? Yep‚Ä¶ this was definitely it! Cat sits in it anyway, so sort of ok, but definitely not as full or plumped up as the images show..",2,2023-09-25
Smaller than expected,Very small,3,2023-05-27
Fake advertising,Looks NOTHING like the photo!It is flat and lifeless in comfort and texture.The material is a shiny texture.My dog won‚Äôt use it,1,2024-06-02
Very small,I had to send it back as it is very small I would say ideally for a kitten. One of my cats is a small cat and this was to small for her.,2,2023-12-15
Not grate,Rather thin and not alot of fluff in it to make a comfortable bed for any animals,2,2024-01-16
depends on your cat in the end,"nicely made and good for price, soft to the touch. initially i thought my cat wouldn't use it because she completely ignored its existence until i put it in a box bed that she also never used, and now it's her favourite thing in the world; go figure.",5,2023-10-13
Soft and cute donut but internally ver small,It was very soft but the sides overlapped the inner area so much that it was too small for my cat even though he is petite.  It was an easy transacted and arrived promptly but I have had to sell it on,3,2022-05-01
Fluffy,It‚Äôs a bit smaller than I expected but is very fluffy and soft. Our cats will only use it if it‚Äôs on the sofa and not on the floor,4,2023-01-20
Comfy,My pup loves it,5,2024-02-13
"Bit small, but does the job",Bit small but does the job,4,2023-05-08
Hmmm,"Although it‚Äôs great and as described, I ordered a small one (own fault) and my kitten doesn‚Äôt even bother with it üòÇ",4,2023-01-15
Ok,The material was not as luxurious as it appeared in the photo image  online,3,2023-02-18
Not very plump,Quite flat returned and purchased a bigger one form b and m,2,2024-01-12
Very small basically a thick blanket.,Quality isn't like the picture. It looks like it has a nice cushion around. it's basically flat. First item I've purchased in awhile that I'm dissappeared with.,2,2023-12-05
The cat loves it but...,Our cat loves it but it is quite low quality. It is soft but not as plush as on the pictures. A bit intentional misleading presentation.,3,2022-10-04
I purchased small,"I purchased  small its to small even for my tiny kitty,It is super soft though and snuggles and Kitty now lays his head on it,overall its really well made and the size is my fault",5,2023-10-05
Super soft cat bed,"Super soft... but my cat is freaked out by it! To be fair, my cat is freaked out by most things, but I do need to cover this with a fleece blanket for her to even consider sitting on it. Lovely and soft and Im sure she will come round to it given more time.",5,2023-08-30
Not as advertised,Very poor quality and nowhere near like what's advertised.Waste of money,1,2024-05-25
Second order seems low quality,"As the difference show....Have I been given a fake on my second order? Its thinner and flatter...Although my kittens seem not to mind it.I am a little disappointed, but my kittens are happy so.... OK I suppose. I was thinking on returning it and get one like the previouse one I ordered.... üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why is it so different and cheap make? I've been ripped off... Although cats seem to not mind it. Damn itWhen it was packed I thought it was the raincover I ordered üòÖüò≥",2,2022-10-04
It's tiny,"My cat is quite petite and sleeps curled up in a small chicken shape. She just fits in this bed, this is for kittens only I'd say.",4,2022-11-30
The medium size is perfect,I bought this for my little elderly cat.and as soon as she got in it she instantly started purring and kneading it. She's loves it. Highly recommend this bed. Very happy with it üòäüòäüëå,5,2023-10-07
Awful!,"To start off with, its a Completely different colour than advertised. Literally looks nothing like the bed. Poor quality, no padding whatsoever and absolutely tiny. Don't waste your money.",1,2024-04-20
As expected,"Cat won't use them, but they are all good",4,2023-02-16
Nice cat bed,"Bit smaller than I thought it would be but my cat still loves it. My cat isn't particularly big but he does live to snuggle up. Would be great for kittens, smaller cats.",4,2022-05-21
Not safe for cats or kittens,"The media could not be loaded.

Tiny,Couldn‚Äôt even fit a small dog,1,2024-05-21
Tiny,This bed is so small I thought they‚Äôd sent a hat by mistake. My poor cat can‚Äôt even fit half her body in it. If I had the time and energy I‚Äôd send it back‚Ä¶ check the dimensions before buying.. or you‚Äôll be wearing it on your head.,1,2024-03-02
