Comfortable and easy to assemble,"Ordered this to replace an old chair, and I'm glad I did.It is easy to assemble--unless, like me, you infer from the illustration of each part by itself that it must be missing the head and lumbar cushions. It's not; they come in the box already in place, and you need only adjust their position to taste. Two other tips:1.  Put the rubber rings on the ends of the assembly and let them stay for a day before you take them off, slide the rest into position under the chair, and put them back on. That made it much easier for me to get them in place with the rest beneath the chair seat. (Alternatively, you might choose to ignore the order of assembly in the manual and put the foot rest on before you place the seat on the base.)2. Double check the tightness of the plastic tubes before you install the foot rest, or you'll have to take the foot rest off, tighten, and put the foot rest back on.That said, it's comfortable, and I appreciate the head and lumbar cushions greatly. I'll update if/when the hydraulic cylinder gives out.... and sure enough,UPDATE: the hydraulic cylinder is indeed dead. It doesn't even rise and then promptly sink when I sit on it. This is quite disappointing. Looking for a replacement--inclined not to ask SITMOD for one, because they gave me the one that failed in relatively short order.",5
Game changer!! (no pun intended),"I decided I needed an office chair upgrade, due to the fact that I spend most of my time at my home office desk. I didn't realize just how uncomfy my old chair was until I sat in this chair! OMG! It's amazing and I'm so happy with my purchase. My favorite part is the footrest which allows me to sit in weird positions like I tend to sit in. I also like that fact that you don't have to put the armrests on if you don't want to. I was super easy to assemble and parts seem well made. I highly recommend this chair to anyone looking for an office or gaming chair.",5
It’s actually great. Definitely recommend.,"The media could not be loaded.
                



So I shopped around for weeks before finally biting the bullet and getting this one. I did NOT want to spend over $100 on a gaming chair, but this is the world we live in and now I’m actually really glad I did. Pretty darn good chair if you ask me. I got it for work because I am fully remote. And I play a lot of sims4. It’s comfortable and I like it a lot. Bit stiffer than I anticipated, but easy to put together and solid for the price point. The low back pillow comes in clutch, but the massage feature is loud so I never plug it in. You can tell it’s a bit cheaper because the cushions are very light weight and not exactly cushion-y. It’s about as cushioned as a block of styrofoam.  The fabric quality and color is spot on though and the foot rest is a great touch, so far I use it every day. I’m 5’0” and wanted something I could fit in and sit cross legged or on my knees when I get restless at my desk and this does the trick.One thing I do really wish was different is the reclining feature. It’s either locked in one spot or unlocked and reclines alll the way back. My chair at work had three settings on that so I could stop it from reclining all the way but still rock. With this had that feature. Still love it though and would recommend it if you’re trying to save money!",4
Broken Arm,Chair came with a broken arm. We sent an email to the manufacturer but we haven’t heard anything back yet.  My daughter loves the chair besides the chair arm being broken.,5
It has it's ups and downs until it doesn't go up or down anymore.,"I bought this chair in 2023 and it actually only lasted about 6 months before breaking.  I'm only writing this review now because I've exhausted myself looking for options to fix it and have come up with nothing.  So here I am, lets start with a general review.First, the chair is quite nice, it looks and feels good, meshes well with my set up, and the massager/pillow combo it came with are a great bonus addition.  The footrest... Exists, and over all the chair felt sturdy, we'll come back to this, when I first built it.One of the first issues I noted was the seat as it very quickly became uncomfortable.  I was able to address that with a cushion I had purchased for my last chair but I understand most people won't have that.  The second issue was quite a surprise as I didn't know it was an issue until I was looking up at my ceiling.  The frame of the chair is extremely cheap, despite being made of metal, and bent until it broke without my realizing it.  I'm specifically talking about the part where the pneumatic tube, if that's the right word for it, connects to the seat of the chair.  Sometime back in October I was watching a show and stood up only for the seat to rise.  At first I thought the release had slipped so I checked the bar but it wasn't working at all.  Deciding that it wasn't that big of a deal I moved on with my life until the next day when it wouldn't raise at all.  I keep the chair low so I didn't really care at that point and sat down, that was a mistake.  As I lay there looking at the ceiling, cursing my old body, I began to wonder what had just happened.  I lifted the chair and noticed that the seat and back combo were wobbling so I took a look under to find that the metal housing around the pneumatic tube was bent and broken.  From the looks of it, the welding went first and then the metal bent and cracked around it.  I don't remember hearing anything that would make me worry about that so I really don't know when or how it happened.  I'm well within the weight recommended for the chair as well so I highly doubt it was a weight related issue either.  Still, I was overall satisfied with the chair and decided to see if I could just buy a replacement part but I had no luck finding it.With that being said, I cannot in good faith recommend this chair.  I mean, it might be okay for like a ten year old but then I'd also worry about safety considering the cheap construction.  On top of that, this is a fairly pricey chair if its only going to last for six months, give or take, of mild use.  I recommend anyone reading this look elsewhere and I hope you find that perfect seat.",1
It's ok,"I've had this chair for a little over a year. It was rather simple to put together but it came with 2 right arms so I had to get a different screw to make it work. Not a big deal but was rather annoying. It looks nice, color was accurate, and it feels nice. However, sitting in it for longer periods is not the most comfortable. The chair also tends to drop as soon as you sit in it 50% of the time. It's not a bad chair but it's not the best.",3
amazing chair,quick and easy to set up. feels amazing and worth the price.,5
Go with another option ...,"Bought this chair to replace the home office chair.  For reference, I'm 5'10"" and 195 lbs.  I've owned the chair for approximately 6 months, though by nature of my work, only used it for half of that time.The positives:  It is a good looking chair.  The lumbar support, after a bit of a break in, is quite comfortable - same with the headrest pillow.  The seat cushion is barely padded, but I prefer my chairs to be firm and it's not terrible for sitting (I sit in it for 12 hours a day).  The reclining is a great option and sturdy for my height and weight.Cons:  The gas lift is possibly the cheapest piece of manufacturing I've ever seen.  For the past several months, it has steadily gotten worse and worse, to the point that if you shift even the barest positions in the seat, it loses pressure and sinks you to the floor.  The chrome cylinder is constantly covered in gunk, presumably oil from inside the lift assembly itself.  The manfuacturers ""contact us"" page is useless (Including the typos on the page) - no response to the three or four requests I've sent.  While I find myself rather handy than most, I see no way to remove this cylinder after installation without potentially damaging the rest of the chair, so even if it could be replaced with another, it'd be improbable to return it to it's original state.Final thoughts:  If you're looking for a budget gaming chair for periodic use and don't mind a firm seat, this might satisfy your needs.  Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere.",2
Easy to Assemble,"I received this chair today. Overall, the chair is comfortable. It took me less than 30 minutes to put together. The directions were easy to follow and I was able to assemble it myself rather quickly. I will update the review after using it for a few months. The fabric has a soft woven feel and the cushioning feels firm. All the holes lined up nicely to screw everything together. I wanted a gaming style chair to have more head support when sitting at my desk all day and this chair does provide the extra support I was looking for.",4
4 Stars only because someone forgot to pack my instructions. Black SITMOD Gaming Chair,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)I recently took the plunge and invested in the SITMOD Gaming Chair for Adults with Footrest in the sleek all-black version, and I have to say, it has exceeded all my expectations.Let's start with the shipping experience. Despite a minor hiccup with UPS causing a brief delay in my shipment, the chair arrived in pristine condition. I was slightly concerned during those extra two and a half days, but once it arrived, the packaging was intact, and the chair itself was in excellent shape.As for assembly, I encountered a small glitch – there were no instructions included. However, I'm pleased to report that the absence of guidance didn't hinder the assembly process. In approximately 20 minutes, I successfully built the chair from scratch without any major challenges. To those who claim this chair is too complicated to assemble, I'd suggest brushing up on your DIY skills – it's a straightforward process, even without instructions.The chair comes with all the necessary bolts and an Allen wrench, making the assembly hassle-free. The stitching on the chair is impeccable, giving it a premium look and feel. One delightful surprise was the spacious seat – it's wider than expected, promising a comfortable gaming experience even during marathon sessions.The inclusion of a footrest adds an extra layer of luxury, providing optimal support for extended gaming or work periods. The ergonomic design is evident, ensuring that every aspect of the chair contributes to a comfortable and enjoyable seating experience.In conclusion, the SITMOD Gaming Chair has won me over with its comfort, ease of assembly, and stylish design. It's a testament to the quality of the product that even without instructions, assembling the chair was a breeze. If you're in the market for a gaming chair that delivers on both aesthetics and functionality, the SITMOD Gaming Chair is a solid choice. Say goodbye to discomfort and hello to uninterrupted gaming bliss!",4
"Although called a ""gaming-chair"" I ordered it mainly for an office chair!","As a slightly short woman I have been looking for an office chair that fits, gives support for my tailbone & hips, as well as giving me lumbar support that I can adjust to my needs, and this chair has delivered on all of those things! Do be aware that the depth of the lumbar pillow cuts into the actual length/depth of the chair's seat. I wasn't sure I would ever use the foot rest but have found that when I do several hours of gaming it has come in very handy to elevate my feet. The only two drawbacks that I have experienced thus far is that the head-rest pillow doesn't come down far enough due to my short stature; my neck hits the chair about where the sides flare out, and the tilt handle is too far down and back to use it without leaning far over and back - if I had extra long arms there would be no problem, and that is why I only gave it a 4-star rating overall.  The seat is quite firm, which I like but others might find it too hard. With the instructions there were several issues: (#1) because I put this together by myself I did not put the wheels on until the whole chair was together, (#2) test the bolt placement for the underside mount of the chair BEFORE anything else [had to send 1st chair back due to them being to far apart], (#3) instructions are not at all clear as to how to bolt the foot rest onto the frame so do not put rubber gaskets on the frame ends UNTIL you have tried sliding frame into holders beneath the chair seat and seeing if the foot rest will stay put and will then flip up. In my review pictures I have 3 showing how the foot rest should be. I like that the lumbar pillow can be moved up-n-down without it falling out, also if you are not going to use the vibrator you can pull it and its USB cord out through the pillow's zipper. I like the material as well, it is not rough on your arms-n-elbows and it is cooler than the fake leather of my old chair. Although this is a tad more expensive than a regular office chair I fell that it is well worth it - just wish it were made here in the USA and not in China where that gov't gets a slice of every business' sales. I looked for one made here but not able to find any even though a few of the really expensive ones are USA companies.",4
Super cool.,Love this chair but recommend having a cushion to sit on the seat is very hard. Other than that love it!!!!,4
Leg rest,Do not count on the leg rest working as this was a poor design on their part other than that chair is comfortable.,4
Shipping could improve chair is great so far,"Delivery takes longer than I would like but overall the chair seems great, but with these chairs time will tell concerning parts loosening.",4
"Not Great, Seller Very Accomodating","the seat has hardly any cushion, it is better to sit on a metal folding chair. If you are a bigger person the sides of the back will squeeze and hurt you. The lumbar support does nothing if you plan to recline the chair at all.The seller is very willing to work with you to get a suitable product weather it be an upgrade or a refund for your purchase. They did everything to solve the situation. I did not like the chair but my petite niece enjoys the chair very much. Please know a bigger person will not be comfortable in the chair but if you are on the smaller side the chair can be a nice asset for a very good price.",4
The Chair is ok.,The Chair is ok. for the money it's about what you'd expect. easy to put together and decently comfortable. don't buy it expecting the most amazing chair ever to exist.,4
Good gaming chair,"I bought this gaming chair for my boyfriend, it was easy to put together and he loves it. It’s a little bit snug for him but he says it’s comfortable so it doesn’t bother him.",4
Not as good as I thought,"The fabric seems nice.  As a bigger guy, it feels stable enough to support me but overall it's a pretty uncomfortable fit since the bucket seat style kind of hugs the hips similar to a race car seat. Also, the stitching is really bad in terms of the logo. So bad that I thought my chair was uneven and spent an additional 30 minutes trying to figure out why. Turns out, the company name goes up and to the right at a slight 10⁰ angle if not a little stronger. Just enough to seem like a factory mess up and also enough to bother anyone with OCD.It came with a pillow for lumber support and a head pillow (likely to hide that offset logo stitching). I plan on using the pillow to hide that embarassing uneven logo from my viewers eye sight while I stream but otherwise, it's not too terrible of a chair. Definitely a ""you get a little less than what you pay for"" situation though. Big quality drop when compared to the GT Racing chair it's replacing.",4
"affordable gaming chair, but have concerns","Lets start with the basics of this chair i have own this chair for almost 2 weeks now.. its a decent height with fair amount of room on the cushion on the bottom when im gaming or typing up something on the computer i have no discomfort but im not exactly comfy either. its like a fair medium for long periods of gaming i game in sessions of about 2-6 hours at a time depending on the day so i can assure you its not a hunk of junk the back massager is a good bonus but i haven't really used it much i plugged it in and i didn't feel much of a difference (I have a back condition) the top extra is nice i will say, i use it often when i recline in it now when i recline in it i dont exactly feel secured but it hasn't broke down on me yet it feels like you're falling in a sense but i am also a larger and tall man so it could just be me now the footrest personally i think its not that great now. if you dont recline and pull it out it feels very flimsy and could break it like fragile so im a little upset with that feeling but when you recline back and use it it does feel sturdy and if you're like me and want to put your feet up without laying on your back from time to time this chair is not for you i would invest the extra 100$ and get something more well known for quality if thats the case the arms i will say not very good the left arm i have 0 problems with but the right arm constantly gets loose on me and i have to keep tightening it about every 3 days but overall i dont have to many complaints with this chair its great if you're on a budget or just want something straight forward this chair is a good fit for you or even a back up chair but if you got the money i would invest in the more expensive chairs for quality but this chair does have its looks and strengths but the downsides are a concern for people like me",3
"Stiff, but comfortable","Has a bucket seat feeling, nice structure and support but lacks in cushioning. Material is a little rough too, I expected a softer texture. Wheels that it came with really sucked, but nothing a simple upgrade can’t fix",4
Comfy,Easy to put together,4
Issues with rest and sides and loose bolts. Overall like design and intention,"Super easy to assemble. The bolts that hold in the leg rest part come loose consistently and were unfortunately recently lost in my move and im unsure what size bolts, but I suppose I'll have to replace them. When the leg rest is out and chair is leaned back the leg rest bends down considerably and it feels like If I use the full top part of the chair it will topple over. The arm rests keep bending well out of place and I quite literally have to snatch them back to their normal position. I like the thought. I like the assembly, but def some errors that need to be upgraded for it to be much better for its intended use.",3
only lasted a year,i loved this chair it was super comfy the issue is it only lasted a year before the foot rest broke then about half a year latter it started slowly going down bit by bit and i couldn't use the lift part to lift it back up it would only went down,3
overall really good for the price,pretty easy to assemble very comfortable and very good back support. very good value.,5
Gaming chair on a budget,"Spent 2 months researching for a good gaming chair on a budget, since I started a little gaming set up. Have to say, I had my doubts because you can’t obviously buy a high quality chair on a budget BUT I’ve been using it for a couple of months now and I have to say I’m surprised of how nice it is. It gets a little uncomfortable on your behind after a couple of hours, if I’m being honest, but overall it gets the job done. It’s simple, pretty and the name of the brand looks good comparing it to others. It’s also pretty wide and you can adjust it nicely for your comfort. The material looks and feels durable and chair overall is very sturdy.",4
Overall acceptable,Bought for son for gaming room purposes. Went together pretty good.Only dislike is arm rest are not high enough to accommodate your needs.Rolls smoothly and sits comfortably.,4
You get what you pay for,This chair is great if you're a child or child sized but if not the arm rest is not your friend. It's much too low for an adult. I'm only 5'10 and after a hour or two my shoulders are killing me. My partner is 5'4 and the arm rest is too low for even him.Giving it a 3 star because I'll admit the seat padding is comfortable enough for hours of gaming and because it's a affordable game chair. But the arm rest is really a buzz kill. Perhaps they should try making it higher or at least adjustable.,3
Great quality,"I absolutely love this chair, mainly because its pink. downside it was missing a few screws, and one of the wheels stick and won't spin or roll.",3
My son loves it,Got this for my son's birthday and he absolutely loves it. It's comfortabke and perfect for taller guys.,5
Broken arm rest,"My husband had an awful time putting the right arm rest together as the screw hole was not threaded all the way through and at an angle. He was able to fix it because he is has extra parts, but it caused alot of unnecessary stress on his part. Other than that it is quite nice very comfortable and glad assembly is behind us. I'm very glad my husband is so awesome or I would have had to return the whole thing because I wouldn't have thought about it. 4 out of 5 would have been 5 out of 5 but assembly wasnt hell. I am 5'10"" and my ankles hang off the foot rest but his fit great.",4
Good for the price,"This chair is comfortable, but hours of sitting on it can leave you feeling uncomfortable. The leg rest doesn’t nearly go out as far as my legs do, so it’s just an awkward position to be in. The arms get loose extremely quickly too, so they just wobble around.",3
Good quality of fabric - sitting wise.....,"When I was looking for a replacement for my racer type gaming chair, I was looking for comfortability and a foot rest, as I tend to game between 2-4 hours (depending on the game I'm on).  The SITMOD chair, while the fabric is really nice, isn't super comfortable due to the lack of cushion. Obviously, when you're sitting in a spot, it's going to form a dent, but because of the lack of cushion, you end up feeling the hard plastic bottom that supports overall.I am in the hunt for a new chair, though I may stick to finding that in-store moreso than shopping for it online.It would be a good chair short term. But if you're planning for long term, you either want to buy a chair cushion pillow or continue looking.",3
My first gaming chair,I have been sitting in a horrible office chair to game for some time and this is a huge upgrade. Arrived in a big box (my cat is super happy) and was so easy to assemble. Pretty sure it took maybe 15 minutes. I use it all the time and love it. I don't use the leg rests as much as I was expecting but it is still a nice added feature. It also comes with a vibration option that requires you to plug the chair in. I honestly had no idea it came with that option when I purchased it. TBH its not that great. But its a nice feature to have.My only con about this is the chair is fairly stiff when you first use it. It does loosen up over time and becomes somewhat more comfortable and I have no major issues with it. But if you like more cushion in your seat I would still recommend this chair and just suggest purchase some padding to rest on top of it.,4
Decent,"It's decent, i wouldn't put anyone or anything that weighs 200lbs in it. I tried sitting in it and using the foot rest to see what it was like, and the foot rest felt kind of flimsy.But it was perfect for my little sister, who only weighs around 100-120lbs.",5
decent,"not as good as i thought it was going to be. for a chair this big, it's not that comfortable. it's decent - better than your average cheap $25 office chair from walmart, but its quite stiff and hard. i can also tell it was cheaply assembled, i can see marker traces left behind from where cuts were made for screws, and some sharp staple ends sticking out of the bottom of the chair. not the best quality but decent. its probably only really worth $90, and you could find a better one for the same price or more.",4
Comfortable. But,"I really like the way the chair felt, however it’s already very wobbly and can’t seem to just down and have the chair be steady. I would like to contact someone for help if there’s any way I could fix",3
"Great, simple chair","I honestly love this chair. I wanted a pink gaming chair for the back support, appearance, and size. I've been working from home since last year and needed a decent computer chair. I really love the design of this one since it isn't the typical ""e-girl"" streamer or the chair with the cat ears in pink. I just wanted something nice that was in pink.I saw a lot of complaints that the chair is firm, but I appreciate that. Every ""executive chair"" I've gotten end up getting too soft and uncomfortable. The support is great if you're going to be sitting in it 8+ hours a day working or gaming.I love that the chair is fabric. I need a lumbar support for computer chairs and the fabric keeps it from sliding. The ability to recline and footrest set this chair miles ahead of any other gaming chairs I looked into.It was very easy to put together and took me less than 30min. The instructions are clear and the package came with all of the parts needed. We will be getting a second chair in a different color for my husbands gaming station. Five stars!",5
Decent chair,This chair took about 45 minutes to assemble. The leg rest seems pretty flimsy. I will probably never use it because I feel like it would start droop down. Material of the chair is nice. Over all I'm happy w/ what I paid and the chairs' quality.,3
READ BEFORE YOU BUY,"This is a cheap chair i have had it for 5 months now. first off they didnt send the right instructions on how to put it together, alright now problem not my first time putting a chair together Got over that, as soon as i sat down in the chair i noticed that the foot rest was very unstable and feels like it is going to break when you put your legs up and im 6'3 weighting 190 pounds. the actually shock does fit right in the chair so there is a slight rock back and forth with it and it gets worse over time. the shock also leaks and will slowly go down and you will have to keep getting back up and reset the shock, for the money you spend on this chair you can get a better one at your local best buy or staples. also warranty doesn't cover the shock problem. they told me that its just how the chair is built and if i get a replacement it will do the same thing. the chair ripped from me putting my foot up under one of my legs ripped within the first week. it is also not very comfortable after about a month the butt cushion just get compressed and feels like wood. there is literally no cushioning left on my chair and i use it probably for 3-4 hours daily. if you do buy this chair just keep in mind it is cheap and you will be looking for a new chair in a couple month i regret buying it and the warranty doesn't cover any really big problems i have like the shock and the rocking to do poor quality material builds. also the wood on the inside is just practical bored so its not very strong and my last thing is the wheel if you can get it to roll one way it will refuse to adjust the wheels and go to the other way i literally have to use my feet and it will drag the wheels. worse chair I've bought",1
Build quality is questionable,Bolt holes weren’t threaded properly left a lot of loose gaps and caused a lot of stripped screws because of the poor Allen wrench they supplied. Would’ve went with a different chair personally if I ordered a new one. Especially for a chair that’s almost $200,3
good,love this product very much,5
I can see how you may think these are awesome,"Long story short this chair is great but simply put, it wasn’t an upgrade from my current chair. My current chair is softer and fits me better especially on the seat.The seat is very long. Imagine sitting all the way back in your sofa. See how your knees touch and kind of lift your feet up? That’s this chair seat.The back support isn’t ergonomical at all. Flat and unwelcoming. The pillows honestly made it worse.It reclines very well and the footrest is DOPE. Unfortunately when I actually got it built and put into my setup, I was like, I’m never going to use that :/It’s a great chair if you don’t already have a great chair. 3.5/5",4
Doesn't last,"I've had this chair for about 6 months now. Using it for a work chair.  The support is gone.  It's like sitting on the floor in terms of hardness, at the end of the day my butt hurts so bad. It also is at a point where it is hard to not slide off the front of the chair because it leans forward.  I'm waiting for my next bonus to be able to buy a different chair.",3
No instructions and came damaged and missing parts,Did not get a manual or USB and armrests are ripped and the levers are bent,3
Comfortable Chair,"This product was received quickly, chair is big and comfortable, the chair is perfect for college studies and gaming.  There is no problem sitting in the chair for several hours. The head rest and arm rests are at the perfect height and lumbar support is helpful.",5
It is an O.K. chair.,"I'm going to start off by saying it is a $150ish chair. With that being said I didn't expect the world out of it.Comfort is a 6/10 the cushion is kinda stiff. and the arms are just cloth covered with no padding. Also the levers are a little hard to reach i find myself leaning way over the chair to reach them.Quality is a 5/10 out of the box there where a lot of loose threads, both of the pillows for the back and neck have a sunk in flat spot. And the chair overall just has a kind of cheap feel,and crunching noises.Ease of assemble is a 9/10 it is pretty straight forward and not a lot of parts.I don't really find my self a ""big"" person I am 5'8 and 190lbs. With that being said if I where a couple inches taller, or a bit heavier I would personally go a different route. If you need a budget chair and don't game for hours on end I would say buy! If you have the budget for a $500 secret lab chair or other brand then save the $150 and just put it towards that.",3
Feels kinda iffy,The wheels really don’t like to spin and for some reason it hits a point and both sides of the wheel pops off easy to put back on but kinda annoying,3
Great chair,"Love the chair. Easy to assemble, comfortable to sit in.",4
comfy and great condition,it was easy to install. it doesn’t come with the massage port as shown and in the instructions it says message the buyer for it but they said they couldn’t send them anymore,4
I mean It’s ‘Ight,"Chair was easy to assemble, the only thing was the holes on the seat that screw into arm chair weren’t pre cut so I had to cut the fabric a bit to expose them, guess someone forgot to cut them out during production",3
50/50 on this chair,"Going to keep this simple..Pros:Sturdy seatNice material & colorLumbar & neck pillows are comfy and supportiveCons:Feels a bit small unless you're sitting uprightButt portion of the seat is made of thin material and feels like sitting on a wooden chair after a bitLeg attachment is very weak and will break eventuallyWheels are pretty stiff compared to most other chairsI'm about 50/50 on this chair. It looks nice and feels nice but I wouldnt recommend this for an ""all day"" chair.",3
So comfy that I fell asleep while racing.,I'm a big sim racer and wanted something more comfy to replace my dying chair. This thing is comfy guys. The chair feels really well made and the foot rest is sturdy. Just don't make a dumb mistake like me and put the o rings on before you slide the footrest in place. Make sure you put them on AFTER. Will be getting more o rings tomorrow. Great product and worth the money.,5
Comfy chair BUTTTT,I love this chair but I've had it for a month and it's wobbling would be an amazing chair if it hadn't started wobbling so soon,3
Is nice,First off... the box it came in took up damn near my whole living room 🤣 But I had it put together in 15 minutes! Didn't need no man! It's wide enough for me to sit cross legged in which I love cause I can never sit like a normal human being. I hoped for a little more give to the seat BUT it's fine the way it is. I'm a big fan of the neck pillow. Overall I love it. I like that it's fabric and not that fake leather mess that peels after time and looks terrible. My arm rests are not wobbly at all like some reviews have mentioned.  Just get it. Don't second guess yourself :),4
Not fully disappointed.,"Big guy review. I bought this because it was 3rd on the list for big and tall chairs. It said in description it was 350lb rating but in photos it showed 400lbs. It barely feels like it will last long which I expected due to my weight. However I fell out of the damn thing this morning because it reclined too fast and tipped over. I blame karma personally, but it did happen lol. Hugs my sides a bit too much because it's kind of like a bucket seat. Arms also don't really support you when reclined all that much. I've taken a couple naps in this chair and it's not too bad. My next chair will be wider, possibly this brand if they have a sturdier one. I would recommend to slimmer people but not for a 6'2 and 280lb guy with love handles.",3
"Looks awesome, easy to assemble, and firm","After a slightly extended shipping time, it finally arrived and I had zero problems following the picture instructions and putting the whole chair together within 20 minutes (maybe less).This chair look really good. The main cushions on the seat bottom and back are fairly firm and the seat is wide (slightly over 20 inches between the two front armrest supports. I will say that this is not uncomfortable. Time will tell how the cushions hold up. The extra head and lumbar (vibrating) cushions are nice additions and really help fill that need for a little extra support and softness. I also really like the overall feel of the fabric that is almost like micro-fiber.I think if the seat bottom had a tilt feature, I'd probably be over the moon with this and give it all 5 stars.If you can time the purchase right with a decent coupon or discount, this is a great chair to pick up.",4
"Super easy to put together, very comfortable","I love it. I don’t usually write reviews, but this chair is saving my back bc I work from home and my chair sucked.",5
"It's ok, would not recommend","The chair is alright but I wouldn't buy another, the assembly was straight forward and had no problem. A few issues one being that one of the screw holes on the bottom connecting the gas tube to the bottom of the seat didn't line up so I was only able to have 3 of the 4 screws put into the base of the chair. Another being that the 4 screw holes that connect a plate to the back rest was angled slightly so now the back is at an angle. The material is cheap wood and slightly scratchy fabric likely something I would get at Walmart for $50 with plastic legs that I would have preferred to be metal and the footrest being supported by these plastic handles that has a hollow metal U shaped bar for the footrest that I dare not use for fear of breaking the footrest that would be better suited for a 8 year old child's legs rather than a 6'1 19 year old males legs. I assume this chair will only last me a few months before I buy a different chair from a more reputable company that is hopefully made in the U.S.",3
As-Expected Budget Chair,"Easy to assembleMaterial is holding up well so farShoulder support areas sound like there is tissue paper inside (it probably is)Leg-rest can be iffy to slide outReclining is excellentMassaging pillow does the jobArms are a little wobbly after a while (generic alan screwholes never hold up with these cheap chairs)For $100 or less, not badOtherwise go to Goodwill or yard sales for a computer chair",4
Nice,The most comfortable chair in the market!!!,5
Will not last longer than 3-4 months,"Unfortunately, this chair stopped worked right after the return period passed.Amazon customer service was absolutely useless, even after a previous representative LIED and told me that I would receive a refund without having to return the defective chair. I don’t mind returning the chair, but ups will not pick it up unless it is already disassembled andpacked in a box. I’m currently disabled, so I can’t disassemble it, and even if I could, I don’t have a box for it.I don’t recommend purchasing anything from this manufacturer, because Amazon will absolutely not help you when it fails.UPDATE: the manufacturer contacted me after I left this review. They did not contact me when I left information on their website.They offered me the option of a replacement or a refund, I chose the refund.So at least the manufacturer responds to negative reviews, I guess.I added 2 stars for the manufacturer’s swift response to a poor rating, for whatever that’s worth.",3
Not too comfy,"Have to edit my review. My husband says the seat is to hard but otherwise it's ok. Was a piece of cake to put together. Screws were all numbered. Foot rest a lil difficult and not real easy to pull out, but I think a little wd40 will take care of that.  The levers are a bit hard to reach but all in all not a bad chair.",4
GREAT PRODUCT EXCELLENT QUALITY,GREAT PRODUCT EXCELLENT QUALITY,5
Great Buy,"This buy doesn't just speak luxury in my office, it is also super comfortable, except for the neck support, that I still haven't found the perfect position that works for me. Love it very much.",5
Great chair and easy to assemble!,"The style color and comfort are as good as it gets! This chair fits my man cave/office perfectly! It's very comfortable and has great style. I'm a 6'2"" and 205 and it holds me easily! The footrest is a great addition and is great for relaxing in style! This chair seems to envelop you in comfort!",5
Would prefer to return it,"This chair came unassembled with no directions! My 13 yr old son and friend put it together but it was complicated. One wheel has never stayed on and when leaning back in the chair (which it is supposed to do) it fell backwards and hurt my son. It overall holds him up, the cushioning is fine and it  looks nice. I wasn't sure how to return an assembled chair and it wouldn't fit in my car, so we are stuck with it. I wouldn't get another one.",2
"Comfortable, seems sturdy, fabric is nice.","I’ve had this chair about a week and it feels/seems pretty sturdy I think it will last a while. The fabric and cushioning are very comfortable, it stays cool sitting in it for a long period. Feels stable too even with it full reclined. Pretty easy to put together, and it’s really nice with or without the pillows.",5
Very comfy,Son loved it,5
Not very sturdy or comfortable for price,"5 months in now and the lifting mechanism is completely shot. I never adjusted much so it isn't an over use issue. It just can't stay up defeating the purpose of the chair completely because it is no longer level with my desk. Prior to this I already was unhappy with the lack of padding/comfort. I'm an over full time student and this cushioning is pathetic. But it served its purpose. Now that this issue occurred I felt like I had to make a review to help other people. I shopped around so much before choosing this and still made the wrong choice, spend the little extra and get something better!!!",2
Gas lift is broken after less than a year,"I used this as a chair for my WFH setup. It was initially comfortable and easy to set up, but the chair did not last. I purchased this in March and by the end of November, my chair slowly sank to the lowest setting over my workday. Here's hoping the company will honor their return policy and either provide a fix or a refund.",3
I. Hate. This. Chair.,"I hate this chair. Hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it.I bought this chair to replace a twelve year old home office chair with a cushion so flat that I could feel the board underneath it. I reasoned that a gaming chair being ostensibly a chair that is supposedly designed for comfort during long hours of gaming would make a decent office chair.Well, it's okay for the amount of time that I use it to do office work, but I do not spend a whole lot of time in my office doing office work.What this chair utterly fails at for me is being a chair that makes comfortable sitting at a computer and playing games for hours. I did this on Black Friday when a lot of people were making the mistake of buying this torture device (and when it was about $30 cheaper than I had purchased it the previous Saturday when my office chair broke). Any position other than having the back of the chair vertical caused the hard seat to press against my tailbone and cause pain as the seat is just terrible. I haven't figured out if the cushion doesn't give or if it just bottoms out and I'm feeling pressure from the plate/board underneath the seat cushion.The seat cushion only stays in one position -- parallel to the floor. It's like sitting on wide stool with a terrible back attached to it by the worst student in a high school shop class. As the seat cushion stays in just the one position, it makes reclining the back of the chair a moot point as this increases pressure on my tailbone. Who exactly is comfortably leaning back in a chair if the seat only stays in one position? And whilst I did not purchase this chair for the leg rest, I find that thing really underscores how wobbly this chair is. Sitting on this chair with the leg rest extended makes it feels like something that would be turned down by IKEA. It just feels chintzy.A good deal if it were being sold for about $100 less than whatever they are pricing it at today, but this chair sure is not worth the retail price they claim to have it marked down from. Buy a real office chair or spend more money on another gaming chair. Avoid this torture device unless you regularly see a chiropractor.",1
"It’s ok, especially for the price.","The chair came packaged well, and was easy enough to put together with just one person. It looks nice in the room. I’m 5’3” and I’ll say that it has a deeper seat than I would prefer but the back/lumbar cushion they provide helps with that. That being said, the head cushion can only be adjusted so low so there ends up being this awkward and uncomfortable dead space between my lower neck and lower back which leaves me hovering over the back by 4-6inches, so there’s no support there and I’ll likely have to get something by to remedy that soon but that might just be a short girl problem. The seat itself was an issue - I have never had tailbone pain/issues before and this absolutely caused some and it also seemed to trigger sciatic nerve issues, tingling up and down the legs. There’s very little cushion, so I ended up buying a seat cushion. The wheels aren’t great either. They’ll get the job done but I ended up spending money on new wheels as well.",3
Nice,Very easy to assemble.,5
Uncomfortable and easy to damage,"The base is stiff and you can feel the gas cylinder through it while sitting. The zipper along the sides doesn’t have a zipper on it so when it easily comes open, which mine did, there’s no way to close it back up. A lot of the fabric starts to fray and the sewing comes undone within a week or two. 2 stars because it looks good and was easy to put together. Otherwise it would be one star.",2
"Easy to assemble, gorgeous, and really comfy","I have a bad back and pretty poor circulation, so this was a great purchase for me. The foot rest is a bit unsturdy, slightly tilting the chair forward when you recline- but it serves the purpose. Really quick n easy to follow assembly instructions.",5
"Solid Chair, justified purchase","I have used this chair for quite a few months now and I must say it has proven to be a very good purchase.First off, the chair was easy to assemble. it comes with easy to understand instructions too.As far as comfort goes, it is pretty comfortable for not being leather. I live in a very hot/humid place so leather was a no-go for me. It reclines well and can handle the bulk of my weight and it still goes up and down with ease when I adjust the lever.Overall, a solid 5/5 for the money I spent.",5
Bolts fallout easily,"have been using for 3 months very comfortable but the bolts have fallen out and I had to rebuild the chair, Tightening them even more and they still fell out",3
BEAUTIFUL AND GREAT quality...,Outstanding product BOTH my grandsons got one for Christmas and they love these chairs.MBGARCIASAT78251,5
Very comfy,When my last gaming chair broke I knew I needed one that was similar in size. I like to sit with my knees up or criss cross applesauce and I needed a big enough chair to do that. The base of the chair is perfect it’s big enough for just that. It reclines well the footrest works great. I love everything about it it’s a great texture and I can sit in it for hours. I don’t use either of the pillows just due to my preference. I did test the lumbar pillow it is really loud and doesn’t feel like it would do a whole lot if that’s why ur buying the chair it’s not the best feature.,5
Decent.,It's decent.,4
Comfortable till it breaks,"I purchased this chair about 4 months ago, and it is extremely nice and comfortable. I would recommend because not everyone will have my experience, but what I will say is the parts seem old and/or cheap. I cant seem to find a support page to get a hold of these guys otherwise as their website just brings me here. I have to replace the piston as it started sagging.. Then apparently the plastic around the cylinder just broke into 5 pieces at the top of the piston where the chrome metal starts to be exposed because of that now the bolts to the left arm are messed up from the offset seating and long gaming sessions so those have to be replaced and my last complaint is the lumbar pillows like flat as cardboard now. even with constant fluffing. Otherwise this chairs been great. Just glad my and half month pregnant girlfriend didnt sit in it when the piston popped on us..",2
Comfortable,Got this for my son for Christmas and he loves his chair.  Very comfortable!,5
Cause of Near Death Experience,"Purchased July 22nd of 2023 (Less than a year!) I went to sit in my chair yesterday evening when it literally buckled and collapsed under me. I yelped. My life flashed before my eyes as I fell plummeted backwards, the back of my skull narrowly missing an art desk behind me. I knew almost immediately that I had jarred my body. My back, neck, and arms are still sore. I'm 100lbs under the weight limit. Ive never before broken a chair (literally was mortified!) I've NEVER used the chair to lean back because I've been scared of falling (how ironic). I rarely used the foot rest. So it was up right, normal height, no foot rest out when this happened. I'm pretty much scared of office chairs now. My husband considered trying to find parts to repair it but I was afraid it'd tried to finish the job, so now it's been banished from the house.  #trauma #emotionaldamage #whenofficechairsattackI'd like some sort of customer service regarding this. An apology? A new chair that doesn't have an assassination attempt on my life? Maybe this one was faulty?Thanks!",1
Get what you pay for,"Hi there! The chair is pretty comfy to start off, haven’t sat in it for prolonged periods of time though. Was 10/10 difficult to put together as NO INSTRUCTIONS WERE INCLUDED. Other than that it seems to be a decent chair.",4
Great gaming chair,I guess I must not have read the reviews or the description very well. Did not realize or expect how soft this chair would be. It was a great unexpected feature! It was easy to set up and glides nicely. My son will get a lot of use out of it,5
Great Gaming Chair,"I ordered this for my son, who's obviously gaming a lot, and I am super happy with the chair. Came right on time, easy instructions, easy assembly and a great looking chair!!! Comfortable, pillows can be removed if wanted and footrest is easy to pull out and hide again when not needed. Would recommend and buy again!",5
Game Chair,I found the seating part is hard..it's not plush..I just used it for the first day on 7/26/23. My bottom is already hurting. Nice chair stable strong chair..but you will need an extra cushion..this is not for everyday work or game playing on this chair..I'll be back sitting on my exercise ball...I'm not sure if you have to break the seat in..but it's hard...and I have my own cushion (buttocks) and it's still hard without an extra cushion.,3
Comfortable,"As someone who is pretty picky when it comes to gaming chairs, this one is pretty comfortable, easy to set up, and is very durable.",5
Easy to assemble but did not come with instructions.,"The media could not be loaded.
                



The chair works well and is pretty comfortable. It’s easy to assembled but it would have been much easier if it would have come with instructions. It would get 5 star’s if it hadn’t been for that. I couldn’t find any online instructions either. The screws are numbered so they are clearly meant too be used on specific parts of the chair so there was some trial and error involved with making sure that correct screws were in the correct holes.Despite’s this it took less than an hour to setup.",4
Good Chair for Gaming,I bought this chair for my son because he was hunching in the other one he had and I was worried about his back. He says it is comfortable and likes the leg rest and that it reclines. It is a good chair for the price.,5
Holes for screws are off,"I was super excites about my chair, up until I got to attaching the bottom bracket to the seat. You cam put any 3 screws in it, but it'll throw off the 4th. Super frustrating. I'm headed to store now to get a file or something to fix it. Besides that everything looks okay. Havnt had a chance to see if it's comfortable or not. Just figured it was worth mentioning here.",3
It's a tiny bit too stiff to be 100% comfortable...,"It's a surprisingly good product for the $. While I suppose I might have made another choice if I'd had the opportunity to sit on it a while before I pulled the trigger, I think it's likely I wouldn't have been able to find anything better for the price.So, it's a good, but not great chair & if you want something better, I think you'd be hard pressed to find it @ a similar price point.",4
It's very comfortable,"The chair was fairly easy to assemble but I'm done places you have to test through the fabric to get to the holes for the screws which made it unnecessarily difficult. The massage feature is a bit disappointing, I could do without that altogether. Overall though it's a fine chair.",4
Broke and not the most comfortable,So I bought this chair Oct of ‘22 and was excited at first. Quickly became uncomfortable. It does not hold up over time. First the cyclinder started leaking and it would just start going down and I would have readjust constantly. Then a year and 4 months in the up and down cyclinder just failed and its stuck in the down position. Really should have lasted longer.,2
Fabrics on the armrest ripped.,Kind of upset the fact the chair doesn't came perfect.but it pretty comfortable to sit for long time.,4
Ehh it's OK,Affordable? Yes. Comfortable? Not so much. The 1st couple of days it was pretty comfortable but as the weeks went on it started to get more and more harder and harder to sit on for long periods of time. Doesn't support my back the way I wish it would and the chair was starting to squeak and pop less then a month of owning it; I'm not sure why I'm only 5'6 &132lbs so I ended up returning it.,3
Awesome chair !,I got this chair for my boyfriend for his birthday and he absolutely loves it. He says it is super comfortable and lives the foot rest it comes with. Pretty durable and supports well. Plus the pillow it comes with has a massaging type for your back!( usb port not outlet to wall) the foot rest isn’t hard to pull out but it id alittle hassle. The recline I. The chair is pretty awesome you can practically sleep in it on how far back it goes.,5
broke after a few months **edited**,"cheap parts, not worth the value, metal bends and break at certain angles if not careful**update*despite the chair breaking, the chair was very comfy and soft, i did enjoy the little back massager that the chair came with and the pillow for extra comfort,great customer services, they reached out pretty quick",5
Not recommended,Bought for less a month. The feet pad is completely useless(cannot hold its position). The sitting pad got broken from inside one day (hear the crack sound) so you easily slew to the floor when sitting on it.,2
Super nice!,"The chair itself is really nice, everything went on tightly, no wiggles on the arm rests THANK GOD. Sitting on the chair it’s pretty firm which I personally don’t mind because overtime it’ll break in and I’ll wish it was firmer. Super big fan of the fabric! I have always had the faux leather stuff and it would eventually just crack and peel away after 3 years so I’m hoping this chair will last longer for me.",4
